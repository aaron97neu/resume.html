# resume.html
an html based resume based off a json file

renders a resume based on a template ```resume.js``` file given, 
which defines the json object that is your resume. 
This json object is of a custom format and an example can be found
in the [aaron-resume branch](https://github.com/aaron97neu/resume.html/blob/aaron-resume/resume.js).

Note that due to the subtle differences in how browsers render HTML/JS, this repo is currently aimed at rendering the resume in a browser to be printed as a PDF for distribution
